##dot-slate AKA .slate

### What It Is

Sharing my .slate setup for the wonderful Mac OS X Window manager namded Slate which can be
found here: https://github.com/jigish/slate

### Setup

  - Clone this repo somewhere
  - Copy the .slate to your ~/.slate
  - Edit the .slate to point to the repo
  - Restart/Reload Slate

## Be Advised!

Slate is powerful and personal.  I've tried to keep this as a universal config as possible, but
surely some personal choices have slipped in.  Take this as a starting point, but please do feel
free to share pull requests if you make changes you feel are broadly useful.
